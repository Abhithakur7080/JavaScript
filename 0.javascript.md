###### What is JS (Javascript)
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex
features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated
2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably
involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies.

###### What 10 Things Should a Serious Javascript Developer Know Right Now?

`Scope` If you don't understand this intimately then you aren't that serious about this language. This is the number one point intentionally and I cannot stress it enough.

`Architecture` You don't have to be a master software architect, but if you cannot perform some basic planning and put pieces together without massive layers of tooling you are an imposter. Expecting frameworks and other tools to simply do it for you isn't very impressive.

`DOM` It is very common to see developers hiding from the DOM by layers of abstractions and
other stupid crap. querySelectors are great, but are also 2800x slower than the standard DOM
methods. That isn't trivial. These methods are super simple, so there is no valid excuse for
developers fumbling over this or hiding in fear. http://prettydiff.com/guide/unrelated_dom.xhtml

`Node.js` If you are a serious developer should have a pretty solid grasp of how to walk the file system. You should understand how to conveniently read files as text or less conveniently read files as bit for bit binary buffers.

`Timing and asynchronous operations` Events, timers, network requests are all asynchronous and
separate from each other and exist both in Node and in the browser. You have to be able to
understand how to work with callbacks or promises.

`Accessibility` The interactions imposed by JavaScript can present accessibility barriers. A serious JavaScript developer is already familiar with WCAG 2.0 and knows how to work within its recommendations or when to push back on violating business requirements.

`Security` You need to have at least a basic understanding of security violations, security controls, and privacy. You don't need to be a CISSP, but you need to be able to supply recommendations and avoid obvious failures. If you cannot get this right in the most basic sense you aren't a serious developer.

`Data structures` You need to understand how to organize data in a way that allows the fastest
possible execution without compromising maintenance. This is something that is learned
through academic study and repeated experience writing applications.

`Presentation and semantics` You really need to have a basic understanding how to properly
organize the content your users will consume and how to present in a consumable way
efficiently. This is something almost completely learned from experience only. You might think
CSS and HTML are simple skills that can be picked up when needed, but you would be absolutely
wrong.
`Knowing when to avoid the bullshit` Many developers lack the years of experience to be
confident in their performance.... so some of these developers will try to fake it. Don't be an imposter, because everybody will see straight through it. Hoping mountains of abstractions,
tooling, frameworks, compilers, and other bullshit will save you just bogs down your application and screws over your teammates. If you aren't confident then be honest about that and seek mentorship or get involved with open source software outside of work.

###### What is JavaScript and how is it used in web development?
JavaScript is a programming language used to create
interactive effects within web browsers. It can be used for
front-end development to create interactive user interfaces,
and also for back-end development to create server-side
applications. JavaScript is one of the three core technologies
used in web development, alongside HTML and CSS.
